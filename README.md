# ftp-search-file
A very simple python script with searching function.

This script navigates recursively server directory to search a specific tag.

          Server IP Address like 127.0.0.1

VERBOSE  

          - 0 No Output

          - 1 Low Output
          
          - 2 High Output
          
TAGS

There is an error in ftp.nlst() with empty dir. The program goes to loop state. Any solutions?
